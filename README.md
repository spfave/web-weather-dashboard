## **Description**
Travel Weather Dashboard provides a search portal for global city locations, returning current weather conditions and a 5-day weather forecast. The application saves recently searched cities and the selected units for data display (imperial or metric, imperial is default for new users). Returning users can quickly select previously searched locations for an updated forecast. 

The website is created with HTML and styled using the Bootstrap front-end toolkit plus additional custom CSS. The site's theme is provided using the [free bootstrap theme Flatly](https://bootswatch.com/flatly/). Site functionality is implement using JavaScript and uses jQuery and Moment.js for specific functionality. Weather data is retrieved through the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). 

Travel Weather Dashboard is built as a client-side only single page web application and dynamically displays weather data to the page provided a response is received from the API.
